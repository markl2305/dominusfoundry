/**
 * MAIL ABUSE GUARD — ported for audit F-0056.
 *
 * These public lead forms send TWO mails: a notification to a server-fixed inbox, and an
 * autoresponder to the address in the request body. The first is why most public contact
 * forms are safe. The second is the finding: an unauthenticated caller names the
 * recipient, and the platform's shared RESEND_API_KEY delivers.
 *
 * ⚠ WHAT THIS FILE IS NOT. `rateLimit` is a FIXED-WINDOW counter held in the module scope
 * of one serverless isolate. It is not sliding, and it is not shared between isolates,
 * regions or cold starts — forge-web's own copy says so of itself, and the header there
 * calling it "sliding window" is wrong. So it bounds a single noisy sender and does
 * NOTHING against a distributed one. It is a volume bound, not an authorization control,
 * and the arbitrary-recipient authority is removed separately by pinning the autoresponder
 * to the submitted address and escaping what goes into it.
 *
 * Ported rather than shared because these are four standalone repositories with no common
 * package. The copies are deliberate duplication, not an oversight.
