          <p className="body-foundry">
            Every major AI lab is building more powerful models. More parameters. Faster inference. Better reasoning.
            Agents that can do more.
          </p>
          <p className="body-foundry">
            Almost no one is building the architecture that makes AI trustworthy enough to actually delegate to.
          </p>
          <p className="body-foundry">
            Capability without accountability is dangerous. We&apos;ve all seen AI systems drift, hallucinate, optimize
            for the wrong things, and erode trust. The industry&apos;s answer is &quot;make it smarter.&quot; Our answer
            is different:

          <p className="body-foundry">What if we built the governance layer first?</p>
          <p className="body-foundry">
            Mentis operates at the frontier of what&apos;s possible with AI memory and behavioral intelligence—then adds
            what no one else is building: a constitutional framework that ensures behavioral coherence over time,
            transparent reasoning, and human sovereignty over delegation.

          <h2 className="heading-forge-lg text-slate-900">Constitutional Intelligence Architecture</h2>
          <p className="body-foundry">Mentis operates on a three-layer governance structure:</p>

            <li className="flex gap-3">
              <span className="text-forge-700 font-bold">•</span>
              <span>
                <strong>Immutable Core —</strong> Universal constraints rooted in human dignity, truth, and
                accountability. These cannot be modified by any party and apply in all contexts.
              </span>
            </li>
            <li className="flex gap-3">
              <span className="text-forge-700 font-bold">•</span>
              <span>
                <strong>Personal Layer —</strong> Your patterns, preferences, and accumulated wisdom. This layer learns
                from both explicit instruction and behavioral observation—and it belongs to you, not to us, not to your
                employer, not to any platform.
              </span>
            </li>
            <li className="flex gap-3">
              <span className="text-forge-700 font-bold">•</span>
              <span>
                <strong>Contextual Overlays —</strong> Organization-specific constraints, tools, and data access. Granted
                and revoked as relationships change. Multiple overlays can be active simultaneously.
              </span>

          <p className="body-foundry">
            The result: AI that adapts to context while remaining anchored to principles. Intelligence that gets smarter

          <h2 className="heading-forge-lg text-slate-900">What Makes This Different</h2>
          <ul className="space-y-3 body-foundry">
            <li className="flex gap-3">
              <span className="text-forge-700 font-bold">•</span>
              <span>
                <strong>Observational Learning with Pattern Synthesis —</strong> Most AI memory is explicit: &quot;remember my
                name.&quot; Mentis watches how you work, synthesizes patterns across domains, and self-corrects when
                behavior drifts. It learns the way a trusted employee learns—through observation, not just instruction.
              </span>
            </li>
            <li className="flex gap-3">
              <span className="text-forge-700 font-bold">•</span>
              <span>
                <strong>Epistemic Transparency —</strong> Mentis knows what it knows and knows what it doesn&apos;t. Every
                inference includes confidence levels, source attribution, and what would change its assessment. No black
                boxes.
              </span>
            </li>
            <li className="flex gap-3">
              <span className="text-forge-700 font-bold">•</span>
              <span>
                <strong>Constitutional Reasoning —</strong> Before executing, Mentis evaluates actions against constraint
                layers and surfaces trade-offs. When values conflict, it shows its reasoning and asks for guidance—rather
                than silently optimizing for the wrong thing.
              </span>
            </li>
            <li className="flex gap-3">
              <span className="text-forge-700 font-bold">•</span>
              <span>
                <strong>Authority Ledger —</strong> Every action includes an immutable record: who authorized it, what scope
                was granted, what constraints applied. Mentis never lists itself as authority origin. All autonomy is
                delegated.
              </span>
            </li>
            <li className="flex gap-3">
              <span className="text-forge-700 font-bold">•</span>
              <span>
                <strong>Anticipatory Coordination —</strong> Mentis doesn&apos;t wait for requests. It predicts what you&apos;ll
                need based on learned patterns and pre-marshals resources across email, calendar, documents, and
                financial systems.

              <span>
                <strong>Family Enterprises &amp; Offices —</strong> Multi-generational continuity requires AI that thinks in
                decades, not quarters. Mentis is designed for inheritance—accumulated wisdom that transfers across
                generations.

                <strong>Professional Services —</strong> Client confidentiality, professional constraints, and relationship
                memory require more than generic AI. Mentis maintains behavioral coherence across engagements.

                <strong>Values-Driven Organizations —</strong> For institutions where principles aren&apos;t negotiable,
                Mentis operates under constitutional constraints that reflect your foundational commitments—not generic
                corporate values, but the actual moral framework your organization was built on.
